# SAMAug: Augmenting Medical Images with Segmentation Foundation Model

### Oct. 12th 2023 Update:

SamAug was presented in the MICCAI 2023 1st International Workshop on Foundation Models for General Medical AI (MedAGI). See https://medagi.github.io/#/program for more details.

### Oct. 5th 2023 Update:

Uploaded python scripts (model training and testing with SAMAug) for the polyp segmentation experiments.

## 
We introduce SAMAug, an efficient method that utilizes a segmentation foundation model (SAM) for improving medical image segmentation. SAMAug utilizes a segmentation foundation model (SAM) to augment medical images. The augmented images thus generated are then used for training and testing a task-specific medical image segmentation model (e.g., a U-Net model for cell segmentation). SAMAug does not require fine-tuning on the foundation model. Please see below for an overview of the proposed method.
